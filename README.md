Multiple choice questions ask people to choose the answer from a list. It mostly used in educational testing. I am going to develop a computer program to read all raw plain text data and produce a detailed analysis report on the competition. I need to write a program that the answer sheets read and converted into a text file using a multiple choice analysis system.


The multiple choice analysis system can provide different functions, including:
1.Question analysis
2.Searching Student
3.Showing the result
4.Exporting Report
